The purpose of the site is to display my talent, abilites and expience in coding. The portfolio features: a blog, Contact information, my current skills, and a bit of information about myself.This site is (hopeflly) accessable for all devices from mobile to pc. 
![SiteMap](/docs/sitemap.png)
This is a sitemap of the website which has not changed form the initial mock up.

After the creation of the sitemape came the wire frames. This is just an example of how the wire frames were laid out for the pages shown in teh sitemap. Translating these to an acutal site was quite a challange with my current knowledge. One challange that i could not solve was to translate the nav bar into a drop down menu when viewed on mobile.

I did find solutions online that would solve this but they  all included Java script which i was not cumfortable using. So for the time being i settled with the current solution with what knowled i have of html and css. In future i would love to dive back into the portfolio and flesh it out fully and host it on another site other than netlifty. Hopefuly i will be able to make it an accpetable portfolio that will impress future employers.
