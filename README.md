## Purpse & Features
The purpose of the site is to display my talent, abilities, and experience in coding. The portfolio features a blog, Contact information, my current skills, and a bit of information about myself. This site is (hopefully) accessible for all devices from mobile to pc.

After the creation of the sitemap came the wireframes. This is just an example of how the wireframes were laid out for the pages shown in the sitemap.
