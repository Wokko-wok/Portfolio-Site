The purpose of the site is to display my talent, abilities, and experience in coding. The portfolio features a blog, Contact information, my current skills, and a bit of information about myself. This site is (hopefully) accessible for all devices from mobile to pc.

This is a sitemap of the website which has not changed from the initial mock-up.

After the creation of the sitemap came the wireframes. This is just an example of how the wireframes were laid out for the pages shown in the sitemap. Translating these to an actual site was quite a challenge with my current knowledge. One challenge that I could not solve was to translate the navbar into a drop-down menu when viewed on mobile.

I did find solutions online that would solve this but they all included Java script which I was not comfortable using. So for the time being I settled with the current solution with what knowledge I have of HTML and CSS. In the future, I would love to dive back into the portfolio and flesh it out fully, and host it on another site other than Netlifty. Hopefully, I will be able to make it an acceptable portfolio that will impress future employers.
